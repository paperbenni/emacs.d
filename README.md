# emacs.d

this is my personal emacs configuration

## installation

```sh
git clone git@github.com:paperbenni/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
```

## Dependencies

```sh
# Arch Linux
yay -S emacs python-epc python-orjson # TODO: more, I know there are more, but I'm lazy
rustup component add rust-analyzer
```

## This is kinda unmaintained

I am migrating away from org-mode (back) to vimwiki and obsidian. 
Emacs is amazing functionality wise, but my god is it slow. 
I give up. My Ryzen 7 and M2 MacBook cannot deliver a smooth experience and
I have not even tried to get this running on my phone.
I am genuinely curious if long time emacs users are not bothered by the constant freezes or
if they just haven't tried any other IDE in the last 10 years.
